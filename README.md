A stack in C is nothing but a linear data structure that follows the LIFO rule (Last In First Out). In a stack, both insertion and deletion take place from just one end, that is, from the top. In contrast to a stack, a queue in C is nothing but a linear data structure that follows the FIFO rule (First In First Out). Insertion is done from the back (the rear end) and deletion is done from the front.
